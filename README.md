# Twitter Sentiment Analysis



In this project, I used Google Colab to analyze tweet sentiments, exploring key machine learning and data science concepts. The project involved importing libraries, cleaning the tweet data, and applying stemming to standardize the text. I used TF-IDF to convert the text into numerical features for model training.

I built and trained a Logistic Regression model to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The model's performance was evaluated using a test set, and adjustments were made to enhance accuracy. This step was crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the model.

Finally, I applied the trained model to new tweets to test its real-world performance. This project provided hands-on experience with the full machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature extraction to model evaluation and practical application.
